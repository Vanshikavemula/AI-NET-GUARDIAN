## 🔧 API Reference

### Core Functions

#### `extract_features(url)`
Extracts comprehensive features from a URL for ML analysis.

```python
from utils.feature_extraction import extract_features

features = extract_features("http://example.com?q=test")
# Returns: array of 30+ numerical features
```

#### `TrafficAnalyzer.classify_traffic(url)`
Classifies network traffic type based on URL patterns.

```python
from utils.traffic_analyzer import TrafficAnalyzer

analyzer = TrafficAnalyzer()
traffic_type = analyzer.classify_traffic("http://cdn.example.com/image.jpg")
# Returns: "CDN", "API", "Web", "Email", etc.
```

### Configuration Options

Create a `config.py` file for custom settings:

```python
# Model Configuration
MODEL_PATH = "model/rf_model.pkl"
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.5
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB = 200

# UI Configuration
THEME_COLOR = "#667eea"
ENABLE_ANIMATIONS = True
SHOW_DEBUG_INFO = False
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run basic functionality tests
python -c "from utils.feature_extraction import extract_features; print('✅ Feature extraction works')"

# Test model loading
python -c "import joblib; model = joblib.load('model/rf_model.pkl'); print('✅ Model loads successfully')"
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Data Privacy**: No URLs are stored permanently; all processing is ephemeral
- **Model Security**: Pre-trained models are included to prevent training data exposure
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are sanitized and validated
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protections against abuse
